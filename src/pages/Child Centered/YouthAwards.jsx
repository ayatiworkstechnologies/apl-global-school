                  opportunity to be the very best they can be. “The objective of
                  this program is to provide an introduction to worthwhile
                  leisure activities and voluntary service, as a challenge to
                  the individual to discover the satisfaction of achievement.”

                These awards are in line with our school’s philosophy of
                holistic development, emphasizing the non-competitive growth and
                progress of young minds. To help our students in reaching their
                greatest potential, the Duke of Edinburgh (DoFE) awards was
                instituted for Grades 9 to 12. The award comprises 4 sections –
                Skills, Volunteering, Physical Recreation and an Adventurous
                Journey.
