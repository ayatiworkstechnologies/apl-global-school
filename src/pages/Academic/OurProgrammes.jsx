                The kindergarten/preschool programme in APL is integrated and
                holistic. It is designed to provide the children with the
                opportunity to develop self-awareness, better communication
                skills, improved balance and coordination and grow to be caring,
                life-long learners. Our Kindergarten curriculum is an in-house
                curriculum where we focus on the PSE (Personal, social and
                emotional) development, communication, sensory and cognitive
                development and all the other areas that form a foundation for
                Grade 1. Learning in APL is experiential, hands-on and
                personalised which helps the children make real-life
                connections. We have differentiated learning classrooms, where
                children learn individually and collaboratively. The environment
                in APL is joyful, purposeful and engaging with lots of
                opportunities to explore without losing focus on the values,
                empathy, discipline and respect.

                Curriculum aimed at developing young learners who are confident,
                responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. Our curricular
                and co-curricular activities are planned with a focus on
                holistic development with an equal emphasis on cognitive
                socio-emotional and physical skills alongside creative
                expression. Learning is exploratory and evaluative in nature.
                Students learn to apply their knowledge and understanding to
                solve new and unfamiliar problems. There are ample opportunities
                to work independently or collaboratively and take intellectual

                A roadmap to learning at the primary level – With a
                student-centric approach to imparting knowledge, students learn
                to imbibe mathematical, language, and scientific skills among
                many others. Children learn to express their voice in multiple
                mediums. By encouraging children to explore, experiment and
                learn independently through activity-based techniques, we seek
                to equip children with skills in problem-solving, critical
                analysis and creativity. In addition to integrating formative
                and summative assessments to strengthen their learning,
                portfolios are created to exhibit the student’s developmental
                milestones. unities to explore without losing focus on the

                The Lower Secondary program is based largely on the Cambridge
                Lower secondary curriculum, that develops our students into
                confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged
                learners. A student at this level will experience ample
                cognitive stimulus and an extensive co-curricular program. Our
                co-curricular activities are designed to supplement their
                curricular learning. They have a choice to learn either Art,
                Music, Drama or Creative Movement as part of the curriculum.

              <p className="text-black font-secondary text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Every child is encouraged and supported to engage in independent
                critical thinking and an array of transferable skills that would
                prepare them for Senior School. The curriculum is supplemented
                by our own History and Geography curriculum that prepares our
                students to seamlessly transition into the Cambridge IGCSE
                program in Senior school.

              <p className="text-black text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg font-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Students are encouraged to learn through projects and guided
                discovery methods, fostering and nurturing their own natural
                curiosity. Our differentiated classroom and personalised
                learning methods allow students to take ownership of their
                learning and progress. This allows every student to develop a
                voice and agency; the confidence to choose for themselves the
                subjects for further study in Senior School.

                In the Senior School, the IGCSE and AS-A level program is geared
                to deliver the Cambridge International curriculum to develop
                learners who are Confident, Responsible, Reflective, Innovative
                and Engaged. With a student centric approach, we aim to foster
                social-emotional and life skills, thereby preparing them for the
                next stage of their educational journey. A broad-based
                curriculum with varied subject choices is offered to match the
                interests and aspirations of all students. Unusual subject
                combinations are often allowed to accommodate individual needs.
                Students are encouraged to make informed decisions in all areas
                of schooling. Student-led initiatives such as ‘Girl-up’, MUN,
                and RCP (Responsible Citizenship Programme) are a highlight.

                A student’s self-image is a direct result of the kind of
                reinforcement he or she receives on a daily basis. NIOS@APL
                strives to empower all students to become stronger and more
                confident, especially in controlling one’s life and claiming
                one’s rights”. Empowering kids by fostering a growth mind-set
                helps children find new ways to look at their abilities. Being
                supportive but being realistic is the key to help children
                develop positive self-esteem.

                The NIOS Curriculum at APL caters to diverse abilities and needs of students with its flexible structure. The students further broaden their scope of learning in areas such as financial literacy, creative expressions, vocational skills programs and intra/interpersonal skills. We encourage students to select their subjects thoughtfully, aligning their choices and assessments with their abilities and future goals.
