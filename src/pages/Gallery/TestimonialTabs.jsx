And in addition to that, CIE trains all its students for an international standard of research and writing – which ended up being the biggest advantage in my case. It provides a customised scholastic experience wherein every student gets the chance to delve deep into the courses of their choice as well as a wide and in-depth study into each course.",

A very special thanks to Susan ma’am for helping me to reduce my examination stress which made me a better person.  It has also heIped me to reduce my health problems too. I would like to say thanks because none of them was able to give me a perfect solution .Teachers of APL have made me such a good student and also encouraged me a lot right from the time I joined the school. I thank the school management for giving me the certificate every year beginning which was like encouragement for me. APL has removed my fear of speaking to teachers. None of the schools will have such friendly teachers. APL has 97% of friendly teachers. I enjoyed being part of excursion to Ooty in Grade 7, Night Camps in Grade 9 and 10, Day Camp in Grade 11. I also enjoyed being part of Synergy in 2012, 2014 and 2015. This was the best school I have ever studied and others students stopped bullying me. I would not have come so far if I hadn’t joined APL. Thanks to my parents for that. I will be in touch with my teachers of APL. I will come to school and meet my teachers whenever I find time.",

I would recommend it as an option to anyone who is looking to build a strong base before pursuing their University education/careers.The subjects offered by CIE were taught in a conceptually strong manner, and this allowed me to realise the importance of going deep into the concepts of any subject in order to fully understand it. The syllabuses offered also enabled a strong understanding of the core of the subjects themselves. This has helped me, and is currently helping me as well, as it has made it easier to learn and grasp unknown concepts being taught at University level.",
