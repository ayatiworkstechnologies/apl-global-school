    bio: [
      "Ms. Gita Jagannathan is the owner and founder of APL Global School, Chennai. She is a voracious reader and connoisseur of fine art, music, and humorous tales. She has a penchant for exploration and thirst to constantly evolve; attributes that reflect her growing-up years when she had to make sense of the cumulative experiences of travelling through 8 different schools, her father having been in a transferable job. APL Global School is the outcome of her search for an inclusive and nurturing space. Gifted with a thirst for the whys and hows of a person’s evolution she spent years reaching out, tutoring and mentoring students who were struggling to fit in despite being intelligent, talented, and hardworking.",
      "This drove her to learn more about giftedness, learning disabilities, and special education. She used the Cambridge International Diploma for Teachers and Trainers and a course with Harvard Wide on Differentiated Strategies to deepen her understanding of pedagogy and learning. Gita is a Reiki Grand Master, a hypnotherapist and a student of Yoga. This spiritual sensibility in combination with her skills in psychology and counseling alchemically contributed to the birth of APL school as a space to experience personalized learning for students, faculty members and all stakeholders.",
      "Gita has put in huge efforts and timeless exploration for the establishment and smooth functioning of the Academy for Personalized Learning or APL Global School. Founding the institute was the beginning of her journey of transforming the education system. Her unique endeavours to make a positive difference in the education sector are far better and more practically-driven as against the conventional form of pedagogy that has been globally followed for so long.",
      "She believes that every human being is unique; that it is possible for each of us to realize our true potential and create an environment that is supportive. In a relatively short span of 13 years, under the tutelage of Gita, APL has gained a reputation for providing a caring educational system that develops every facet of a child’s personality. Her aim is to have every student become a happy and healthy individual who confidently explores the limits of their own potential.",
