                 We believe in preparing learners for life in a world where they will interact with compassion, courage and resilience; a mindset that respects differences. The school will therefore be a community of stakeholders invested in the personal, intellectual, social, physical and spiritual development of every learner. Children are provided with a variety of options and multiple opportunities to learn and succeed. Every child will be nurtured to take an active role in making this planet inclusive and self-sustaining.
